1
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:27,075
BED AND BOARD

2
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,975
Two pounds of tangerines, please.

3
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,075
Here you are, mademoiselle.

4
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,575
Not mademoiselle - madame!

5
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:53,975
- I'd like this magazine, please.
- Very well.

6
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:58,175
What a lovely poster of Nureyev!
May I have it?

7
00:01:58,275 --> 00:01:59,975
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

8
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:02,375
- Help yourself.
- Very nice.

9
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,775
Terrific. How much?
- Two francs.

10
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,675
- Thank you.
- Thank you, mademoiselle.

11
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,975
Not mademoiselle - madame!

12
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,275
Go ahead. You're faster than me.

13
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,275
Hi, there. I have to run.
I forgot the red.

14
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,875
Hi, Antoine. How are things?

15
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:09,640
Are they going to turn red?

16
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:12,275
We used that same trick in school.

17
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:17,040
We'd dunk a flower
in the ink pot till it turned black.

18
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:20,275
Then we'd press it in our notebook.
Always caught heck for it!

19
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,575
Look, they're already starting
to turn red.

20
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:27,775
<i>Soon you won't be able to dump
that stuff in the sewer. I saw it on TV.</i>

21
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,075
<i>- Why the hell not?
- Water pollution and all that.</i>

22
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:36,675
Even shaving cream.
Everyone has to use an electric razor now!

23
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,375
- Look how red they are now.
- That was fast!

24
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,275
Because of my immersion heater.

25
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,875
Funny - there's always one
that doesn't change color.

26
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,775
Yes, and I never know why.

27
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,275
Hello, Antoine.
Still with the colors?

28
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,475
Ginette, what are you doing here?
I don't pay you to goof off!

29
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,875
You know what I did?
I bought new pyjamas.

30
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,575
I threw away the bottoms
and kept just the top.

31
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,375
What do you say to that?
- Not a thing.

32
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,275
<i>Ginette, sometime today, huh?</i>

33
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:14,975
Good day, madame.

34
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,975
So the flowers have arrived,

35
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,875
and the blue ones have turned red!

36
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,775
No, vice-versa!

37
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,575
It's an old story. I said,
"Listen, Mrs. Fournier, be nice.

38
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:31,875
My radio isn't bothering anyone. "

39
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,875
And she said, "So sue me!"

40
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:38,675
I pay taxes, and what does she do?

41
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,575
I should have sued her!

42
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:46,375
But that was ten years ago.
What can I do now?

43
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:49,275
If I had it to do over-

44
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,875
The yellow ones turned red!

45
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,975
I've been watching you.
Why don't you start your own business?

46
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,475
<i>Antoine, telephone!</i>

47
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,575
<i>Hurry up!</i>

48
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,075
Ah, hello, Mammy!

49
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:25,875
Sure, I'll get Christine.
Don't hang up.

50
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:39,375
Madame, could you tell my wife
her mother's on the phone?

51
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,475
Hello, Mother?

52
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,275
I can't hear you.
- It's the garbage cans.

53
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,975
Tonight?

54
00:05:57,075 --> 00:06:00,875
No, I don't think Antoine has plans.

55
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,375
Shall we bring something?

56
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,575
I said shall we bring something?

57
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:12,475
Very well. 8:30 then.

58
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,175
See you tonight, then.

59
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:21,475
Mother's invited us to dinner at 8:15.

60
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:24,375
- I'll close the shop and be right up.
- Okay.

61
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,675
Hello, Ginette.

62
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:42,475
I want you, and I'll have you!

63
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:47,275
Christophe, give me a hand
with this, will you?

64
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:05,875
<i>I'm coming, dear.</i>

65
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,875
<i>I'm almost ready.</i>

66
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,975
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

67
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,575
You can set your clock by that guy.
It's 7:15!

68
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,775
He's a singer at the opera.
Always exits on cue!

69
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,375
<i>You should know - they live next
to you. - Yes, our neighbors.</i>

70
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,375
He's always right on time

71
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:09,540
and always furious at his wife.

72
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:15,075
She's like you with your flowers:
A little red here, a little blue there.

73
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,475
Antoine, look!

74
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:58,275
<i>Christine, would you get
the wine from the cellar?</i>

75
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,675
<i>The personnel wanted to work!</i>

76
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,175
Antoine, come help me.

77
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,575
<i>Go on, Antoine.</i>

78
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,775
Can you reach that bottle for me?

79
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,275
Hey!

80
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:47,175
<i>The senator's friends told him
his Mercedes was bad politics,</i>

81
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:51,375
<i>so he got a Citroen instead,
and I got the Mercedes,</i>

82
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,475
which I'll sell for a pretty penny.

83
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,975
<i>- I see you have striglias.
- What?</i>

84
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,475
<i>People confuse them with oubiglias.</i>

85
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,975
My neighbor gave them to us.
I helped her paint her attic.

86
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:04,575
Really?

87
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,875
I thought you brought them

88
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,875
for Mother's Day.

89
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,575
Mother's Day? I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

90
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,075
Mother's Day was invented
by the Nazis anyway.

91
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,275
- Really?
- During the war, the Germans-

92
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:23,175
They've held up well.
I put aspirin in the water.

93
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:26,375
You put aspirin in the water?

94
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:31,775
That's nonsense.
You have to cut the stems.

95
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,340
I do cut the stems every morning.

96
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,275
And then you put them back
in the water? That's no good.

97
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,375
You have to cut the stems
in the water.

98
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:47,575
No air gets in the stem, and the water
is pulled right up to the flower.

99
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:52,375
- Did your Japanese expert teach you that?
- Yes.

100
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,975
The Japanese know
everything about flowers.

101
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,675
Floral art.

102
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,040
My soup?

103
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,675
- I didn't get any soup!
- I'm sorry!

104
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:05,575
By the way, I spoke to the senator.

105
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,675
He's interested in your idea
for a self-service flower stand.

106
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,975
He might be willing to invest.

107
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:14,775
I've lost interest in that.
I gave it some thought and-

108
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,275
Too much spoilage, right?

109
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,175
It might work near a cemetery,

110
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:23,375
where you could make wreaths
with the left-overs.

111
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:27,275
I'm looking into something
a little more interesting.

112
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,675
A process to obtain Absolute Red.

113
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:36,475
I'll tell the senator to forget
about the self-service stand.

114
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:43,075
In any case, he's promised you'll get
your phone within three weeks.

115
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:45,875
That's great!
My pupils can call me directly.

116
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:48,075
Did you get the message
about little Marianne?

117
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,975
Yes. Her dentist canceled,
so she came over.

118
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,875
Who's this "little Marianne"?

119
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:55,275
The little virtuoso
who plays better than you?

120
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,875
That's going a little far!

121
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:59,875
She's talented, but her mother
always forgets to pay for her lessons,

122
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,175
and I don't dare bring it up.

123
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:06,375
- Call me. I'll bring it up, all right!
- You're down in the courtyard.

124
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,075
Doesn't matter.
I'll nab her when she comes down.

125
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,075
Children, I've got a great idea.

126
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:20,075
If the mother forgets to pay,
let her go. Don't say a word!

127
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:23,175
Soon as she's gone,
you play a prearranged tune,

128
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,075
and Antoine will know
she's on her way down.

129
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,575
Great idea!
But what should I play?

130
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:32,175
<i>- Bridge over the River Kwai.
- No, too obvious.</i>

131
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,275
Something lively.

132
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,875
<i>- Autumn Leaves.
- Too slow.</i>

133
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,975
<i>Carmen!</i>

134
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:44,975
<i>- The Jewel song.
- No, no one knows that.</i>

135
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:49,275
Keep thinking!

136
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:53,275
<i>- The Marseillaise.
- That's it! Sure!</i>

137
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:56,275
It's a classic. No one will suspect.

138
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,475
Hold on! No! You can't.

139
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:01,975
<i>- Why?
- You can't play the Marseillaise.</i>

140
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,875
- It'll ruin Christine's violin.
- What do you mean?

141
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:10,375
I mean, you can't fiddle around
with the national anthem!

142
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,875
I'll hit the switch.

143
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,075
There's something creepy
about that guy.

144
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:55,275
Did you ask Mrs. Martin who he is,
where he comes from?

145
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,075
She doesn't know. He's a sublet.

146
00:13:57,175 --> 00:13:59,275
Not a single visitor or letter
in three months.

147
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,075
Did you see those big, hairy hands

148
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,325
with spindly fingers

149
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,175
and hairy knuckles

150
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:12,775
that come out at night
to grab women's legs?

151
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,575
Stop it!

152
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,675
Oh, I forgot the light!

153
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,275
- Don't look.
- No, I'm reading.

154
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:55,975
Naked men are revolting.

155
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,575
If I were a woman, I couldn't stand it.
Naked men are disgusting.

156
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,175
- Not all of them.
- Yes, all of them.

157
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,975
- All except one.
- Ah, you're right!

158
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:09,075
All except one.

159
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,675
Who's that clown?

160
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,775
Nureyev, the great dancer.
I think he's very handsome.

161
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,975
The newspaper vendor gave it to me.

162
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:23,275
Oh, my poor breasts.
If I have a child, I won't breast-feed him.

163
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:27,275
Well, don't look at me.
He'll have to fend for himself.

164
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,875
- Let me see.
- Stop it!

165
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:39,175
Come on, show me.
What's wrong with your breasts?

166
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,975
They don't match!

167
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,075
You're crazy.

168
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,175
One is bigger than the other.

169
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:54,275
- That's not true.
- I'm afraid it is.

170
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:57,475
- Everyone's are like that!
- Not true.

171
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,675
You might give them names
to tell them apart.

172
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,775
Laurel and Hardy, for example.
- Stop!

173
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,175
No, I'm serious.

174
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,875
Or perhaps you prefer Don Quixote,

175
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,975
and this plump little guy
would be Sancho Panza.

176
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,575
Antoine, you're not funny.
Now, good night!

177
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:16,275
Nothing like a warm,
cozy bed at night...

178
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:37,275
Antoine, wake up.
My pupil will be here soon.

179
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:45,875
Five sheep, four sheep,
three... two... one... zero sheep!

180
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,275
Hello, Marianne. Madame.

181
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,675
My wife will be here in a minute.

182
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,575
Your pupil's here.

183
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,775
I'll leave you now.

184
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:19,175
Please come in.
Sorry I was a little late.

185
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,375
Did you practice, Marianne?
- Yes.

186
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,075
Did you work on your scales
and sostenuto?

187
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,575
- She practiced for an hour every day.
- Very good.

188
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,475
Let's start with this piece, all right?

189
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:44,975
Pay attention to your attack and tone.

190
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,975
REPAIR SERVICE

191
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,075
How are you, Doinel?

192
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,975
Anyone here?

193
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,275
Concierge?

194
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:26,075
Excuse me. Could you tell me-

195
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,475
Doinel!
- Hi. How are you?

196
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,675
Same as always.
What's with the flowers?

197
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:34,475
I'm dyeing them.

198
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,075
Did you start your own business?

199
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,275
No, I work for the shop
on the corner.

200
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,275
Looks like hard work.

201
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:45,075
My grandfather always said, "When
the lazy man gets going, watch out!"

202
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:48,275
Didn't you get married?
- Yes. I live here.

203
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,875
Hear that violin? That's my wife.
She gives music lessons.

204
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,575
A musician, huh?

205
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:58,475
You always did love music...
and nice bourgeois girls!

206
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:00,675
I never thought of it like that.

207
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,975
I don't fall in love with a girl -
I fall in love with her whole family.

208
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,575
Her mother, her father.
I like a girl with good parents.

209
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,975
I enjoy parents -
as long as they're not mine!

210
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,175
- You there.
- What's this guy want?

211
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,175
- Is that your truck parked out front?
- Yes. Why?

212
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,340
- You can't park there.
- Why not?

213
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,775
I gave you one ticket.
Want to try for two?

214
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,275
Go ahead, Pops. Make it a pair!

215
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:30,175
I'm supposed to fix a TV set.
You know a guy named Desdoigts?

216
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,275
Monsieur Desbois?
He lives up there.

217
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,675
That's strange.

218
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:42,575
- Probably went out for some shopping.
- I'd be surprised.

219
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:46,375
He hasn't gone out in 25 years.
A kind of voluntary confinement.

220
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:50,475
Says he won't set foot outside
until Marshall what's-his-name-

221
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,975
- Marshall Juin?
- No, before that.

222
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,575
The guy who led France during the war.

223
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,075
- Ah, Marshall Pétain.
- That's the one.

224
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:02,675
He won't come out until
they bury that guy at Verdun.

225
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,875
What's he up to?

226
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,075
This guy's here to fix your TV.

227
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:14,775
It's about time!
Come up, and make it quick.

228
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,775
Hold your horses. I'm coming!

229
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:22,775
- How's Josiane?
- What Josiane?

230
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,375
Didn't you marry her?

231
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:31,275
No, she left the company
to marry an astronaut!

232
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:34,475
Seems those guys make a bundle,
and they're never home!

233
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:37,975
She's living in style on Avenue Foch.

234
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:42,575
He married her
'cause he knocked her up,

235
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,175
and I'm sure she let herself be...
you know.

236
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,475
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

237
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,540
She's really doing great!

238
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:16,575
Thanks to Mrs. Doinel.
She's an excellent teacher.

239
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:21,475
Sometimes I can't tell if it's my wife
or Marianne playing.

240
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:26,675
Soon you'll be giving Mrs. Doinel lessons,
and she'll be paying you.

241
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,675
Oh, I forgot to pay your wife!

242
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:33,975
- Don't worry about it.
- Please. I owe her for last time too.

243
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,675
- There's no rush.
- This is for two lessons.

244
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,675
Thank you. Good-bye now.

245
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:05,875
- What's that, Doinel?
- A library staircase.

246
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:08,575
- Could you lend me 30 francs?
- Sure.

247
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,875
- Is it heavy?
- Not really.

248
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:16,475
Okay, then.

249
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:20,475
Thanks.
- See you.

250
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,375
What are you doing up there?

251
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,125
- Playing scales.
- Can't you play scales down here?

252
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,967
It's for stage fright.
I panicked at my last concert.

253
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,775
I realize now it must have been
the orchestra pit.

254
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:52,175
So it's actually vertigo.
I'm practicing to get over it.

255
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:56,375
Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking of something.

256
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,675
I'll bet! Let me down.

257
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,475
Wait. Close your eyes
and don't move.

258
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:05,975
- I know what you're up to!
- It's not what you think.

259
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,675
Close your eyes. I won't touch.

260
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:10,040
- You swear?
- Scout's honor.

261
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:13,975
- You were never a boy scout.
- You bet I wasn't!

262
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:16,175
Keep your eyes closed.

263
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:17,975
Are they closed?

264
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,075
You can open them now.

265
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:39,175
- What's this?
- A library staircase.

266
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:42,575
I've always wanted one.
- But we don't have a library.

267
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,275
You have to start somewhere.

268
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,940
I have a surprise for you, too.

269
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:52,575
The senator came through.
We've got a pretty little phone.

270
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,075
Not bad, eh?
- Sure.

271
00:23:57,175 --> 00:24:00,375
I promised Lucien you'd write
the senator a thank-you note.

272
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:03,675
First let's see if it works.

273
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,475
<i>What's the number for time?
- Odéon 84-00.</i>

274
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:20,075
Cochin Hospital?
Sorry, wrong number.

275
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,775
I called time and got a hospital!

276
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,975
Then call the hospital
and you'll probably get time.

277
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,375
How's the letter coming?

278
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:32,375
- Almost finished.
- May I read it?

279
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,475
"Dear Senator, thanks to you
I got in one week

280
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,375
what the common man
waits years for in France. "

281
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:40,575
You're crazy.
You can't send this!

282
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,075
- It's the truth, isn't it?
- Antoine, listen to me!

283
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,375
Lucien went to a lot of trouble.
The senator's one of his customers.

284
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:52,375
That's how I feel.
If you don't like it, write it yourself.

285
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:54,775
I'll do that!
You're a selfish man.

286
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,475
Everyone has to help you,
never vice versa.

287
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,475
I never asked for anything.

288
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:02,275
I never wanted the damn thing.

289
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:06,975
I know. Then friends could call us,
or we could call them when we're bored.

290
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:10,275
Bored?
I don't know what boredom is!

291
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:14,775
I've heard people talk about it,
but I don't know what it is.

292
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:18,575
There's always something to do:
Cut the pages of a book,

293
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,775
do crossword puzzles, take notes.

294
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:27,875
I wish there were 30 hours in a day,
'cause I never get bored!

295
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:32,975
I can't wait to get old
so I can get by on five hours' sleep!

296
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,375
Why am I even discussing this?
I'm going to the bathroom.

297
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:45,275
Off to school, Christophe?
No strike today?

298
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:50,275
Hello, Marcel.
Up bright and early, eh?

299
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:52,975
- Chilly today.
- I should give you a set of keys.

300
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:55,875
You're not too bright, eh?
They're right here!

301
00:25:57,075 --> 00:25:59,675
Give me a hand here.

302
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:03,740
Pick up the pace, Marcel!

303
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:08,475
- Are these cans quieter?
- Yes. They're from the new management.

304
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:10,475
- Have they got wheels?
- No.

305
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:13,875
The new management got them.
They don't make noise.

306
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,075
You look a little nervous
this morning, Antoine.

307
00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:22,475
I'm testing a new invention of mine.

308
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:24,475
If it works, I'll get Absolute Red.

309
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:27,775
If it doesn't,
I'll be reading the want ads.

310
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:35,175
I checked our horoscope.
It's very favorable.

311
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:39,375
There are big things ahead
for you and me!

312
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:55,175
I used too much.
What do you think?

313
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,775
That's not really red, is it?

314
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:02,375
Better start reading the want ads.

315
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:12,775
<i>Important American hydraulics company,
recently established in Paris,</i>

316
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:17,475
<i>seeks ambitious, dynamic
young man with English skills.</i>

317
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:13,275
<i>"Dear sir, allow me to introduce
the son of my good friend Baumel.</i>

318
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,675

319

324
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:42,075
Excuse me, miss.

325
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:45,275
I have an appointment with the manager.
Would you kindly give him this letter?

326
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,475
- Of course.
- Thank you.

327
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,275
The manager will see you now.
Please follow me.

328
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,675
Wait a moment.

329
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:30,075
Tell Mr. Max the applicant is here.
- You could say good morning.

330
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,075
Good morning.
Now hurry up!

331
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,675
- You look good enough to eat!
- Hands off!

332
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,375
Yes, he's here. Very well.

333
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:44,175
You better watch out.
I'm hungry!

334
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:53,275
If I had breasts,
I'd fondle myself all day long.

335
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:58,675
This letter is very flattering.

336
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:07,675
- You speak English well?
- I speak a little.

337
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:22,375
You read better than you speak.

338
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:42,875
The problem for our employees
is transportation. Do you have a car?

339
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:55,875
I can't start you out at the top,

340
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:58,375
but I'll give you a chance
on the scale models.

341
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:16,075
We've built a model of a harbor,

342
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,575
with port installations.

343
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:23,475
You'll maneuver the boats.

344
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,375
You like the job?

345
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:32,875
You'll see. My employees
are so happy working here,

346
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,675
they hate to stay home on Sundays!

347
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:41,875
There's the port
based on developers' plans.

348
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:46,475
The problem is, the harbor silts up.

349
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:49,775
We built a dyke
from there to there.

350
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,075
Everything else is built to scale.

351
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:58,275
Your job is to steer the boats
by remote control.

352
00:31:58,475 --> 00:32:01,875
Push a button and off they go.

353
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,475
"You like the job?

354
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:07,275
You'll see. My employees
are so happy working here,

355
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:10,125
they hate to stay home on Sundays!"

356
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,775
He uses that line on all the new hires.

357
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:21,575
They've got nerve...
printing that in the paper!

358
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:27,675
It's about the Common Market
in Brussels. Listen.

359
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,175
"The meeting adjourned at 8:00 p. m.

360
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:35,475
Upon returning to their rooms,
each delegate found a lascivious broad. "

361
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:38,775
- That can't be.
- I swear. Listen.

362
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,275
<i>Imagine... in Le Monde!</i>

363
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:46,275
"Upon returning to their rooms,
each delegate found a lascivious broad. "

364
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:49,175
- I don't believe you.
- Read it yourself.

365
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:54,975
"Upon returning to their rooms,
each delegate found...

366
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:58,275
a lavish spread. " You liar!

367
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:01,775
Lights out.

368
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,375
- I had you there, huh?
- Yeah.

369
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,175
Remind me to tell you
something tomorrow.

370
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:08,975
- What?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.

371
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:12,175
- Why not now?
- You won't be able to sleep.

372
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:25,275
I bought some. Just a minute.

373
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,275
A new brand.

374
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:38,975
It's great!

375
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,975
I know that guy!

376
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:52,175
He owes me money. Hide me!
I don't want to embarrass him.

377
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:54,675
Hey, Doinel.

378
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,175
How are you?
- Hi.

379
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,175
- I owe you 30 francs, right?
- Well, yes...

380
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:05,175
Lend me another 20,
and I'll pay back the 50 all at once.

381
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:09,975
How're things?
- Fine.

382
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:17,975
- See you around.
- Thanks.

383
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:28,140
- You can leave me here.
- Here?

384
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:30,775
You don't have your violin.
- I'm not giving a lesson.

385
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:34,175
- Where are you going? - Do you
always tell me where you're going?

386
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,875
See you tonight.

387

<i>Short, quick breaths. Keep going!</i>

<i>Mrs. Doinel,
I have something for you.</i>

395
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:22,075
An ad for expectant mothers.

396
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:30,775
- Hello, Césarin.
- Mr. And Mrs. D.

397
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:35,875
Looks like Mrs. Doinel
got stung by a mosquito!

398
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:38,875
That was no mosquito!

399
00:36:39,475 --> 00:36:41,675
Watch out.
Here comes the strangler!

400
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,075
Mean-looking guy.

401
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,275
<i>I'm coming, dear.</i>

402
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,475
Let me help you.

403
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:04,875
Thanks a lot.

404
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:09,375
Any day now, huh?
You're so lucky!

405
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:17,475
No, Mr. Doinel isn't in.

406
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:19,975
Wait! Don't hang up.

407
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:23,775
Is this the hospital?
No, but I can give him the message.

408
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,975
Is it a boy or a girl?

409
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:30,875
<i>Mr. Max, a little further
that way with the boat.</i>

410
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:41,375
Call Antoine.

411
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:45,375
It's a boy!

412
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,875
Congratulations, Antoine!

413
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:08,175
A beautiful little boy.
Under the sign of Aquarius.

414
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:11,075
I'd say he's in the arms of Morpheus!

415
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:14,475
- Join us for dinner?
- No, I'm staying with Christine.

416
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,475
Go, then. Don't keep her waiting.

417
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,675
He could have brought her
some flowers.

418
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:24,975
He ran here from the office.

419
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:26,775
He had no time.

420
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:29,375
Now's the time to buy them
the apartment next to them.

421
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:32,375
Knock out the joining wall
and it'll be perfect.

422
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,875
Careful! Support his head.

423
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,875
This is a remarkable baby!

424
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:41,175
I knew he would be,
but he's even more than I expected.

425
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:44,875
I'll make him what I could never be -
a great writer.

426
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,875
Victor Hugo or nothing!

427
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,575
What Napoleon achieved
with the sword,

428
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:53,975
you'll achieve with the pen.

429
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:57,375
Did you see him smile
when I picked him up?

430
00:38:57,475 --> 00:39:00,475
You're crazy.
Babies can't smile until three weeks.

431
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:02,875
Well, he smiled at me.

432
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,675
Madame, would you like
to have a picture taken?

433
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,475
No, I'm tired. Another time.

434
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:14,075
Well, I'm not tired.
Send the photographer in.

435
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:38,775
I'd like to be alone.

436
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:42,875
You can have dinner with my parents.

437
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:47,175
They invited me, but I said
I was going to stay with you.

438
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:54,175
I can tell you a story,
or we can listen to the radio.

439
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,475
Go away!

440
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:01,475
- Fine.
- Please.

441
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:05,675
Very well.

442
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:08,275
See you tomorrow.

443
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:21,575
On a night like this,
I didn't want you to be by yourself.

444
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:24,775
I waited for this baby all by myself.

445
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:57,875
Jacques!

446
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:03,475
How are things?
- Fine.

447
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:06,875
Great news: I'm a father!

448
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:08,975
- No kidding!
- I've got a son!

449
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,840
- You must be happy.
- Incredibly.

450
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,475
- Don't I owe you 50 francs?
- Yes, you do.

451
00:41:13,575 --> 00:41:17,575
Lend me another 50?
I'll pay it back all at once.

452
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,875
Sure, happy to.

453
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:24,075
- You must be really happy!
- You bet I am!

454
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,175
See you.

455
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,475
May I speak to Jean?

456
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:20,075
Ah, hello, ma'am.
May I please speak to Jean?

457
00:42:20,675 --> 00:42:24,275
Please tell him
Antoine Doinel is a father.

458
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:30,275
Tell him Antoine Doinel
has a little boy.

459
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:35,675
Thank you. Don't forget
to give him the message.

460
00:42:36,475 --> 00:42:38,075
Good-bye.

461
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:48,575
We have to stop by City Hall
tomorrow to register him.

462
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:54,275
Have we decided on a name?
I prefer Ghislain.

463
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:59,175
Ghislain sounds snobbish,

464
00:42:59,575 --> 00:43:01,975
like he wears little velvet knickers.

465
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:04,875
Then you think of something better.

466
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:09,175
I really like Alphonse.

467
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:14,075
Sounds like a peasant.

468
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,275
Besides, Ghislain is my uncle's name.

469
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:20,875
Christine Darbon Doinel.

470
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:23,675
What name have you chosen?

471
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:34,675
- So how did it go? A little boy?
- Yes.

472
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:37,675
How did it go?

473
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:41,075
It was a little hard at first,
but she's doing fine now.

474
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:42,975
Congratulations!

475
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:46,775
- Antoine, give me a hand.
- I'm really happy.

476
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:49,375
Is your wife in the hospital
for a week?

477
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:51,075
Yes.

478
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:57,375
Don't you get bored in your bed...
at night... all alone?

479
00:43:58,075 --> 00:44:00,375
No, I'm just fine.

480
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:03,575
- Is he cute?
- Yes, he's all pink, with tiny hands.

481
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:06,575
Congratulations on the blessed event!

482
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:16,475
Better watch out for him,
with all the babies kidnapped lately.

483
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:20,875
- The strangler!
- So you call him the strangler too?

484
00:44:20,975 --> 00:44:22,475
Stop staring!

485
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:25,075
She's right. Everyone inside.
The drinks are on me.

486
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:29,575
You're paying?
Then it really is a blessed event!

487
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:32,375
Drinks for all - even you!

488
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,475
You all right?

489
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:10,875
That's that!

490
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:16,475
You have to be in shape for this!

491
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:20,175
This is fantastic!

492
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:25,375
You like it?

493
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:27,375
This will be our room.

494
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,575
No noise from the street.

495
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,975
I can wave from our window
right over there.

496
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,075
The baby's room will be over there.

497
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:40,575
Do you like it?

498
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:44,475
Terrific!

499
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:52,375
Go ahead.

500
00:45:57,175 --> 00:46:00,175
Bye for now.
I have to make dinner.

501
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:02,575
Good-bye.

502
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,075
- I saw you.
- What?

503
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:13,675
- I'm not blind. You like her.
- Who?

504
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:16,175
Silvana! You like her!

505
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:22,275
A pretty Italian woman
with big breasts and luscious lips.

506
00:46:23,675 --> 00:46:25,575
Bastard!

507
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:37,040
You remember our first kiss?

508
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:38,975
I was terrified. I couldn't move.

509
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:41,575
What? You made the first move!

510
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:45,475
- You've got it backwards.
- No, I remember perfectly.

511
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:49,540
The taxi stopped and I leaned over

512
00:46:49,575 --> 00:46:53,075
to give you a little good-bye kiss
on the cheek.

513
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:56,275
I saw you had your lips
slightly apart.

514
00:46:56,575 --> 00:46:59,675
"She really wants me to kiss her!"

515
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:01,675
You're hallucinating.

516
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:05,575
I'm not saying I didn't like it,
but you made the first move.

517
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,075
That's your story!

518
00:47:07,175 --> 00:47:09,775
You lunged at me
and I just went with it.

519
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:14,375
No, I remember perfectly well
how it was.

520
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,875
Your head was tilted back,
eyes closed,

521
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:22,675
lips slightly apart, just like this.

522
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:30,175
You'd been thinking about it.
- About what?

523
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:32,375
About the fact we'd kiss one day.

524
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:34,475
Well, of course.
Every girl thinks about that.

525
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:37,975
"Every girl thinks about that. "
So you admit it, then?

526
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:50,675
I've come for Ghislain.

527
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:52,475
He was very good. He didn't cry.

528
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,875
Soon I'll be able
to give lessons at home again.

529
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,775
Hello, little fellow.

530
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,975
There's a letter for you.
Where did I put it?

531
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:05,075
A declaration of some type.
Did you name the child Alphonse?

532
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:08,875
- Alphonse?
- Yes. Look right here.

533
00:48:09,175 --> 00:48:12,875
This is Antoine's doing,
and he won't get away with it.

534
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:15,675
He knew I didn't like that name,
but he wanted the last word.

535
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,169
I'd lay her badly
but I'd lay her gladly!

536
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,869
Alphonse will be a great writer.

537
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:36,969
You know what?
I'm going to teach Alphonse myself.

538
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:41,069
He will never go to school.
That way he'll only learn important things.

539
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:45,269
We'll see about that later.
Come, my little Ghislain.

540
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:51,769
What a pretty little bottom
this baby has.

541
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:53,969
Like his mother!

542
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,169
Watch your daddy.

543
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:04,934
He's on his way
to the bathroom.

544
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:08,769
He'll take enough gear
for an arctic expedition.

545
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:11,369
A flashlight...

546
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:13,269
a book...

547
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:15,569
Oh, the pages aren't cut yet.

548
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:22,469
A knife... and now
what's he looking for?

549
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:26,869
The newspaper.

550
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:35,569
- Didn't you do the shopping?
- What shopping?

551
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:39,569
- I left a list on the table.
- I didn't see any list.

552
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,969
There's nothing to eat.

553
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:46,169
- Nothing to eat?
- No, it was all on the list.

554
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:50,469
Ask Mrs. Martin to come up
and we'll go out to eat.

555
00:49:50,669 --> 00:49:53,969
- She's not home.
- What do we have in the fridge?

556
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:55,469
Alphonse's baby food.

557
00:49:55,669 --> 00:49:58,469
Good. We'll have that.

558
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:01,634
You think so?
What if he wakes up?

559
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:05,169
You know he never wakes up
once he falls asleep.

560
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:08,569
We'll buy some more tomorrow.
Come on, let's eat.

561
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:20,269
<i>Tonight, direct from Marienbad...</i>

562
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:32,269
Antoine, look.
It's our neighbor - the strangler!

563
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:37,769
- Did you know he was an actor?
- No. Is he a singer?

564
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,769
No, he does impressions.

565
00:50:41,669 --> 00:50:44,569
<i>You kept an old picture of me.</i>

566
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:46,669
He's not bad!

567
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:50,569
He's great!

568
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:54,469
<i>Perhaps it was in Karlsbad,
or Marienbad.</i>

569
00:50:56,069 --> 00:51:00,169
<i>Once again I walk
through the drawing rooms,</i>

570
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:05,569
<i>the long corridors,
luxurious, lugubrious.</i>

571
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:10,069
<i>But I'm not an apparition.</i>

572
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:12,934
<i>I am a woman,</i>

573
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,269
<i>which is just the opposite.</i>

574
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:18,169
<i>You say I'm exceptional.</i>

575
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:21,269
<i>You're right. I am.</i>

576
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:32,269
We saw you on TV last night!

577
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,869
You were great!

578
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:41,369
You little sneak!

579
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:45,869
You never told us you were an actor.
- I recognized him right away!

580
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:31,469
Hello, Doinel.
I see you're doing fine.

581
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:37,069
THE NEXT MORNING

582
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:10,469
Remember me?
I work at the hydraulics company.

583
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,569
- I brought you something.
- Come in.

584
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:24,369
You saw me lose this?

585
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:27,569
Yes, I saw it fall in the water.

586
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:30,169
I was very surprised
you didn't say a word.

587
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:34,969
The American gentleman told me
the model was very fragile.

588
00:56:35,169 --> 00:56:40,469
I was sorry to lose my bracelet,
but I didn't want to bother you.

589
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:43,669
- I thought you'd like to have it back.
- Thank you very much.

590
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:45,569
Come in.

591
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:55,369
Miss Maki, my friend and roommate.

592
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:21,869
Won't you sit down?

593
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:24,169
Thanks, but I really should be going.

594
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:29,669
- We were just having some tea.
- I'm afraid I must be going.

595
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:34,069
I'm sorry.

596
00:57:37,769 --> 00:57:40,769
- Well...
- I'll show you out.

597
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,469
Good-bye.

598
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:06,269
Hello, Antoine.

599
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:09,169
We don't see much of you
since you changed jobs.

600
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:12,269
Working for the Americans now, eh?
Do they pay you in dollars?

601
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:16,469
Yes, but the best thing is
I have time to think.

602
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:19,469
- 'Cause I'm writing a novel.
- No kidding!

603
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:22,569
Don't tell my wife.
I write at night while she's asleep.

604
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:24,769
So you're a novelist like Baudelaire.

605
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,769
Did you know he started out
in flowers too?

606
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:31,969
<i>- Baudelaire wasn't a novelist.
- What about Les Fleurs du Mal?</i>

607
00:58:32,004 --> 00:58:36,169
- That's poetry.
- Listen, I know more about him than you.

608
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:41,069
I just read an article about him.
Did you know he was a priest's son?

609
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:44,934
His father was an ordained priest,

610
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:49,169
and later worked
for the Choiseul-Praslin family

611
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,469
as a tutor for the children.

612
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:56,569
So what's your novel about?

613
00:58:56,669 --> 00:59:00,569
Oh, you know:
Life in general, my youth,

614
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:04,169
moving from the personal
to the universal.

615
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:09,369
I trust I'll get an autographed copy.

616
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:11,369
Of course. "For Césarin. "

617
00:59:11,669 --> 00:59:14,869
- What's the title?
- I haven't found one yet.

618
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:17,569
Oh, that's not hard.

619
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:20,769
Any singing in your novel?
- No.

620
00:59:21,069 --> 00:59:22,969
- Any dancing?
- No.

621
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,669
Then call it
"No Song and Dance"!

622
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:29,769
Not bad, huh?

623
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,769
Well, see you later.

624
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:38,369
What do you want?
We're closed.

625
00:59:38,469 --> 00:59:41,869
What are you looking for?

626
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:43,469
A fight!

627
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:48,869
Okay, listen.

628
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:54,169
Behave yourself.
You're among friends, okay?

629
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:56,469
Nothing here but old folks and kids.

630
00:59:56,869 --> 01:00:00,369
You wouldn't pick a fight
with them, would you?

631
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:05,769
Go out here and take the first right.

632
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:09,169
You'll find what you're looking for.

633
01:00:17,669 --> 01:00:19,469
What are you reading?

634
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:22,869
<i>Japanese Women?
- It's for work.</i>

635
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:31,069
Let me see.

636
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:34,969
Those glasses look great on you.
- I don't like them.

637
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:37,369
No, they look great.

638
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:40,169
I'm done.

639
01:00:48,669 --> 01:00:52,669
<i>I know why you say that.
She wore glasses.</i>

640
01:00:52,769 --> 01:00:55,969
- Who?
- The girl from the Youth Concerts.

641
01:00:56,169 --> 01:00:58,969
- She didn't wear glasses.
- I thought she did.

642
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:01,669
She made you suffer, huh?

643
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:04,969
She really put me through the wringer.

644
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:08,269
What a nightmare!

645
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:11,769
But one night I just
fell out of love with her.

646
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:15,969
One moment I was in love.
An hour later I couldn't stand her.

647
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:19,869
I was over her.
- It must be something she said.

648
01:01:19,904 --> 01:01:21,669
Exactly.

649
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:25,769
I can't even remember what.
But it was a relief.

650
01:01:29,169 --> 01:01:31,869
If I asked you a favor,
would you do it?

651
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:33,369
Depends.

652
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:38,269
Dodging, eh? Will you do it?

653
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:40,569
That depends. Just ask!

654
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:43,669
Would you put your glasses back on?

655
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:31,269
- Am I early?
- Not at all. Come in.

656
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:35,269
- How are you?
- Fine. Yourself?

657
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:40,069
- What shall we do tonight?
- I thought we might go to a movie.

658
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:43,869
I've got a program,
but I haven't had time to look yet.

659
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:49,069
I thought we might have dinner here.

660
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:50,569
That would be nice.

661
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:54,969
- We could go to a movie later.
- Fine.

662
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:59,969
You take a look. I'll be right back.

663
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:49,969
My friend says she's sorry,
but her mother is very ill

664
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:52,769
and she can't join us for dinner.

665
01:03:52,804 --> 01:03:55,169
I hope it's nothing serious.

666
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:57,669
Oh, yes, she's very sick.

667
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:00,169
She has to leave this instant.

668
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,269
DO NOT DISTURB

669
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,669
<i>You're just getting home?</i>

670
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:10,869
<i>I had to work late.</i>

671
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:14,369
<i>- You know what time it is?
- I had to eat!</i>

672
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:19,669
He sneaks in, thinking I'm asleep.

673
01:05:19,769 --> 01:05:22,269
It was 3:00 a. m.!
I demand an explanation.

674
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:26,369
You know what he says?
"I had to eat!"

675
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:29,569
<i>Kyoko loves Antoine.</i>

676
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:41,469
<i>Come when you can,
but can soon.</i>

677
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:52,969
<i>She says good night
and thinks of Antoine.</i>

678
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:09,469
- The porter gave me these.
- For whom?

679
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:12,269
- He didn't say.
- Must be for you.

680
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:16,169
No one would send me flowers here.

681
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:19,269
They must be for Nicole.
- I don't know.

682
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:23,869
Oh, I know now-
- Are you crazy? Keep dreaming!

683
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:27,369
They just might be for me.
Let's see.

684
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:31,469
There's a name here in small print.

685
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:37,569
They're for Doinel!

686
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:40,469
Congratulations!

687
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:57,869
- What floor?
- First.

688
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:31,869
Hello, Christine.

689
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:33,969
<i>- How are you?
- Fine.</i>

690
01:07:34,169 --> 01:07:37,069
<i>Was someone with you?
- No.</i>

691
01:07:39,669 --> 01:07:42,469
Hi, Christophe. What's that?

692
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:46,969
- May I see Alphonse?
- Of course. He's in there.

693
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:51,369
<i>See what Christophe brought?
- I know what those are.</i>

694
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:54,469
<i>I brought them for you.
I must have dropped them on the stairs.</i>

695
01:07:54,969 --> 01:07:57,669
<i>Besides, I was afraid
you'd think it was silly.</i>

696
01:07:57,869 --> 01:07:59,769
<i>Not at all. They're lovely.</i>

697
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:03,069
<i>Aren't you going to change?
We're going out tonight, remember?</i>

698
01:08:03,169 --> 01:08:05,469
<i>I didn't forget, but I can't tonight.</i>

699
01:08:05,569 --> 01:08:08,869
<i>I have to go back to work.</i>

700
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,569
- How do you say that?
- Nose?

701
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:24,569
<i>You said mashi mashi on the phone.
What does that mean?</i>

702
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:26,969
<i>Not mashi mashi.
Moshi moshi.</i>

703
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,769
It means hello.

704
01:08:29,769 --> 01:08:31,269
Hello?

705
01:08:31,469 --> 01:08:36,869
<i>If you say "hello, hello,"
is it moshi moshi, moshi moshi?</i>

706
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:40,669
<i>No, just moshi moshi.</i>

707
01:08:53,469 --> 01:08:55,969
This is nice, isn't it?

708
01:08:57,569 --> 01:09:00,569
If I commit suicide with someone,

709
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:03,769
I'd like it to be you.

710
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:39,669
<i>Her name is Kyoko,
and she loves you.</i>

711
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:47,169
<i>I'm coming!</i>

712
01:10:18,369 --> 01:10:21,369
If she were just another woman,
I'd understand you being jealous.

713
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:25,369
But Kyoko is another world.

714
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:29,969
You understand?
She's another world.

715
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:33,569
- What's that?
- I'm giving a lesson.

716
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:35,669
At this hour?

717
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:38,769
Where's the violin?

718
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:41,834
I'm staying at a hotel.
I'll come for Alphonse tomorrow.

719
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:46,069
Listen, you sleep in the bed,
I'll sleep in the chair. It'll be fine.

720
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:48,269
I won't sleep
in the same room as you!

721
01:10:48,469 --> 01:10:52,469
Fine! Then we won't sleep
in the same room!

722
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:12,469
Evening.

723
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,269
It's like a smokestack in here!

724
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:18,269
You snuck out bright and early
this morning.

725
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:21,469
At least let me give
Alphonse a kiss.

726
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,769
We were supposed to have a talk.

727
01:11:24,169 --> 01:11:27,569
Remember?
- We've all the time in the world to talk.

728
01:11:27,769 --> 01:11:30,269
Besides, I can't be late to work.

729
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,469
Your parents are coming to dinner.
They want to see Alphonse.

730
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:36,469
They'll be here any minute.
- My parents?

731
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:39,369
- Didn't you tell them no?
- What was I supposed to say?

732
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:43,869
You're crazy! I haven't even told
my mother what's going on.

733
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:46,869
Call and tell them they can't come.

734
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,169
It's no use. They've left by now.

735
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:53,969
Besides, they'll figure out
what's going on when they see this.

736
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:57,069
You're revolting!

737
01:11:57,469 --> 01:12:01,869
My mother will have a heart attack!
Help me put this back.

738
01:12:01,969 --> 01:12:05,969
It's the only way. Give me a hand.
- You go on that side.

739
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:10,169
Careful with my manuscript!

740
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:14,069
A lot you care!

741
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:31,869
Did Antoine tell you we were coming?
Here, we brought dinner.

742
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:34,669
I'm going to see Alphonse.

743
01:12:34,769 --> 01:12:38,069
- What's that?
- A little duck for Alphonse.

744
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:41,834
You're looking strange.
- I'm fine.

745
01:12:41,869 --> 01:12:44,469
- No, you really look strange.
- I'm fine.

746
01:12:44,669 --> 01:12:47,469
Listen, the duck's for Alphonse,
not for you.

747
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:51,769
I say that 'cause I just read
an interesting novel

748
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:53,869
<i>called The Mischievous Duck.</i>

749
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:57,169
It's about this bourgeois judge

750
01:12:57,469 --> 01:13:01,469
who goes crazy for a little duck
someone bought for his son.

751
01:13:01,569 --> 01:13:02,969
Very strange.

752
01:13:03,069 --> 01:13:05,869
No chance of that happening to Antoine.
He doesn't like things.

753
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:10,369
He prefers people,
though he's very partial to yellow.

754
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:14,669
- Look at this little sweetie.
- He's so cute.

755
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:17,169
He's grown, huh?

756
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:19,269
See the little duck
Lucien brought you?

757
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,069
Want to go to Mommy?

758
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:27,369
- Watch. He's almost walking.
- Christine, he's too young!

759
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:32,469
He doesn't like that at all.

760
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:36,034
I'll call you.

761
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:38,569
<i>Good. We'll go see Colette
at the hospital.</i>

762
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:40,269
Good-bye, Lucien.

763
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:42,769
Good-bye, Lucien.

764
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:46,269
Please forgive us.
I was very tired tonight.

765
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:49,769
<i>Don't worry. We were all
a little off our game tonight.</i>

766
01:13:49,869 --> 01:13:52,069
<i>Go on, now. You'll catch cold.</i>

767
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:57,069
Come help me move the mattress.

768
01:13:57,369 --> 01:14:00,269
- Is that really necessary?
- Yes, it is.

769
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:05,269
The world won't stop turning
if we sleep in the same bed, you know.

770
01:14:05,304 --> 01:14:06,869
I'm not like you.

771
01:14:06,969 --> 01:14:10,869
I don't like things
fuzzy and vague and ambiguous.

772
01:14:13,269 --> 01:14:15,469
I like things to be clear.

773
01:14:15,669 --> 01:14:17,069
Listen, Christine-

774
01:14:17,269 --> 01:14:20,069
Don't come near me.
There's nothing between us.

775
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:23,169
- Then what the hell am I doing here?
- Good question!

776
01:14:23,469 --> 01:14:25,769
Fine!

777
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:41,769
I'm splitting!

778
01:15:38,769 --> 01:15:40,669
TUESDAY

779
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:07,169
THURSDAY

780
01:16:32,569 --> 01:16:33,569
SATURDAY

781
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,269
I don't know what I'm going to do.

782
01:17:08,669 --> 01:17:11,669
- You're living alone for now?
- More or less.

783
01:17:11,704 --> 01:17:13,469
Isn't that hard?

784
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:15,969
Oh, I don't mind being alone.

785
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:19,069
I get scared when I'm alone at night.

786
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:21,969
I'd marry a streetlamp
if it could carry on a conversation.

787
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:27,169
Oh, it's you, Silvana.

788
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:29,969
Antoine stopped by yesterday,
so I thought-

789
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:34,169
- Listen, I know life. He'll be back.
- I don't think so.

790
01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:36,069
I handled it very badly.

791
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:38,569
When things started to go wrong,
instead of fixing them,

792
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:41,369
I got scared and made them worse.

793
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:45,034
You have to be patient!
All men are children.

794
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:48,669
<i>- I thought you loved your wife very much.
- Yes, very much.</i>

795
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:52,769
When we met, I was astonished
at her good manners.

796
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:55,469
She was so polite I had to laugh.
It was very touching.

797
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:57,469
Then it got on my nerves.

798
01:17:57,769 --> 01:17:59,769
"Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am.

799
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:02,369
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.

800
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:04,369
Thank you for calling. "

801
01:18:06,469 --> 01:18:08,669
At first I called her "Peggy Proper. "

802
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:11,819
"Peggy" for her reserved, British side.

803
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,869
<i>And "Proper"
because that's how she is.</i>

804
01:18:14,904 --> 01:18:17,869
Know what I mean?

805
01:18:17,969 --> 01:18:20,569
I was a virgin when I met him,
and don't think I'm proud of it.

806
01:18:20,604 --> 01:18:22,469
My parents let me date all I wanted,

807
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:24,969
but I was afraid of guys
and believed certain things.

808
01:18:25,269 --> 01:18:29,769
A virgin at 20- can you imagine?
A walking fossil! A real idiot!

809
01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:33,169
I had some crazy ideas about life too.

810
01:18:33,269 --> 01:18:35,969
Still, it's very exciting.

811
01:18:36,069 --> 01:18:39,969
No, now I know the truth,
and I realize life is disgusting.

812
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:42,069
You should see her smoke.

813
01:18:43,169 --> 01:18:45,169
She doesn't know how.

814
01:18:45,569 --> 01:18:48,269
She holds it clumsily
between her fingers,

815
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:50,569
like a little girl
pretending to be a woman.

816
01:18:51,169 --> 01:18:53,269
He's really funny.

817
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:56,869
And despite everything he's done,
he never bores me.

818
01:18:56,969 --> 01:18:58,669
Ever notice how
he always has a cold?

819
01:18:58,769 --> 01:19:01,269
That used to bug me so much
when we first got married.

820
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:04,269
I felt like saying,
"Would it kill you to use a handkerchief?"

821
01:19:04,469 --> 01:19:08,869
Now if he's not sniffling,
I think he's sick.

822
01:19:08,969 --> 01:19:10,969
See there?

823
01:19:11,569 --> 01:19:13,769
That must be my husband.

824
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:16,369
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Silvana.

825
01:20:22,169 --> 01:20:23,669
Was Alphonse good?

826
01:20:23,769 --> 01:20:26,969
He was great.
He smiles and blows kisses.

827
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:28,934
<i>- You noticed too?
- Yes.</i>

828
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:33,269
<i>One of his lower teeth
came in yesterday.</i>

829
01:20:33,569 --> 01:20:36,869
He's got a little tooth!

830
01:20:37,469 --> 01:20:40,369
I packed your summer clothes for you.

831
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,369
I'll pick those up another day.

832
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:46,969
Could you zip me up?
I'm very late.

833
01:20:51,069 --> 01:20:53,969
He's playing with a program.
Can he have it?

834
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:58,869
<i>No, he'll tear it up.
I went to the ballet the other night.</i>

835
01:20:59,769 --> 01:21:03,469
<i>- What's this written here?
- Nureyev's autograph.</i>

836
01:21:03,869 --> 01:21:06,269
We went backstage
to see him afterwards.

837
01:21:06,369 --> 01:21:08,269
Frankly, I find that very provincial,

838
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:11,669
bothering some guy backstage
who's just danced for two hours.

839
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:14,269
Don't start, okay?

840
01:21:17,869 --> 01:21:21,369
I've come to look after Alphonse.

841
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:23,569
Am I early?
I'll come back in a bit.

842
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:26,869
- Not at all.
- Evening, Mrs. Martin.

843
01:21:27,169 --> 01:21:29,769
Come in.
Go say hi to Alphonse.

844
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:40,269
What's Mrs. Martin doing here?

845
01:21:40,369 --> 01:21:43,769
- Yes. What's she doing here?
- She's going to watch Alphonse.

846
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:59,869
I'd like a cab at 17 Rue Descazes.

847
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:05,369
Six minutes? Thank you.

848
01:22:06,169 --> 01:22:09,069
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

849
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:13,169
Stay a while with Alphonse if you like.
Mrs. Martin will make dinner.

850
01:22:13,469 --> 01:22:15,469
No, I'll walk you down.

851
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:18,269
Good-bye, my little man.
Be good.

852
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:24,369
- You know how to turn on the TV?
- Yes.

853
01:22:24,669 --> 01:22:27,169
- Take good care of Alphonse.
- I certainly will.

854
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:34,669
- Take this picture.
- No, I gave it to you. It's yours.

855
01:22:34,704 --> 01:22:37,369
- Please take it.
- It's yours. You keep it.

856
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:39,469
All right.

857
01:22:49,169 --> 01:22:52,269
Remember when we'd go out
and you'd say,

858
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:55,269
"I'm taking my keys too
in case we get into a fight"?

859
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,769
<i>I'm glad to see you in a good mood.</i>

860
01:23:01,069 --> 01:23:03,869
Surprised? I know when you come here
you must think,

861
01:23:03,969 --> 01:23:08,769
"She's going to yell at me again!"
Admit it!

862
01:23:08,804 --> 01:23:10,669
I admit nothing of the kind.

863
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:14,769
- Don't kiss me.
- I just thought-

864
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:23,569
- Let me go.
- I was trying to help you.

865
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:25,569
I don't need help.

866
01:23:25,869 --> 01:23:28,869
You can be so unpleasant!

867
01:23:28,969 --> 01:23:31,534
And you're insensitive!
Always what you want!

868
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:35,669
Kiss you when you want,
leave you alone when you want.

869
01:23:35,769 --> 01:23:38,569
I'm not at your beck and call.
At least not anymore.

870
01:23:38,669 --> 01:23:40,469
All right!

871
01:23:42,469 --> 01:23:44,969
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

872
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:48,969
I understand-
- No, I know that trick too.

873
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:52,469
"I understand. I'm rotten.
You're too good for me. "

874
01:23:52,669 --> 01:23:55,969
- I'd never pull that.
- You've pulled that a hundred times.

875
01:23:56,169 --> 01:23:58,269
You can put it all in your book.

876
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:03,069
Just so happens I've almost finished.

877
01:24:03,769 --> 01:24:07,269
It's all I think about.
If I'm a little confused, that's why.

878
01:24:09,569 --> 01:24:12,669
I'm sure things will be better
between us once it's finished.

879
01:24:19,169 --> 01:24:22,769
Don't bother sending me a copy.
I won't read it.

880
01:24:25,169 --> 01:24:28,269
I don't like this business
of writing about your childhood,

881
01:24:28,369 --> 01:24:30,569
dragging your parents
through the mud.

882
01:24:30,669 --> 01:24:32,869
I don't know much,
but one thing I do know:

883
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:37,069
If you use art to settle accounts,
it's no longer art.

884
01:24:37,869 --> 01:24:41,669
I've been thinking
the same thing myself recently.

885
01:24:43,469 --> 01:24:46,269
Do what you have to do,
but let me be.

886
01:24:47,269 --> 01:24:50,169
I'm not proud and never have been,

887
01:24:50,269 --> 01:24:53,269
so I can tell you: I still love you.

888
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:56,069
But I'd rather not see you anymore.

889
01:24:56,269 --> 01:25:00,369
Call me when you're coming
to see Alphonse so I can step out.

890
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:03,669
Come on. The taxi's coming.

891
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:15,769
- Where the hell is it?
- They said six minutes.

892
01:25:17,769 --> 01:25:20,269
Anyway, I hope you're happy.

893
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:22,769
I don't think that way anymore.

894
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:25,534
It can't work.
She and I hardly talk.

895
01:25:25,569 --> 01:25:29,069
- You just have to smile lovingly.
- That's exactly what we do!

896
01:25:29,169 --> 01:25:33,369
I have lockjaw from so much smiling.

897
01:25:33,769 --> 01:25:36,869
Restaurants are the worst,
waiting between courses.

898
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:39,969
She smiles and expects me
to make small talk.

899
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:43,134
I can't even eat. It's terrible!

900
01:25:43,169 --> 01:25:46,269
I said I was going away for a few days
for some peace and quiet.

901
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:48,469
I feel sorry for you!

902
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:51,569
Here we go.
Where are you going?

903
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:55,369
I don't really know.

904
01:25:55,669 --> 01:25:58,469
- Shall I drop you off somewhere?
- No, that's all right.

905
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:00,169
Just a minute.

906
01:26:01,069 --> 01:26:03,869
Shall I cancel my plans
and stay with you?

907
01:26:04,169 --> 01:26:06,569
Shall we go to a movie?

908
01:26:06,969 --> 01:26:10,469
No, I'd like to be alone,
wander around a bit.

909
01:26:10,969 --> 01:26:12,769
You're sweet.

910
01:26:17,769 --> 01:26:19,669
Kiss me.

911
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:30,269
You're my little sister,
my daughter, my mother.

912
01:26:30,369 --> 01:26:32,969
I'd have liked to be your wife too.

913
01:27:14,269 --> 01:27:16,969
Wait here a moment.

914
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:21,569
No, wait here.
I'll be right back.

915
01:27:50,769 --> 01:27:52,969
Where are you going?
Don't you like any of them?

916
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:55,769
I didn't know it was like this.
It's a little awkward.

917
01:27:56,169 --> 01:28:00,369
It's easy. Look and choose.

918
01:28:00,669 --> 01:28:02,369
Come on.

919
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:16,069
Follow me.

920
01:28:28,769 --> 01:28:31,369
It's slow around here now.

921
01:28:31,469 --> 01:28:33,869
There used to be clients
until the 23rd.

922
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:36,769
Now everyone's broke
by the 15th.

923
01:28:36,969 --> 01:28:38,869
Some administration!

924
01:28:38,969 --> 01:28:42,469
When I saw 'em on TV,
I knew they'd screw us over.

925
01:28:42,969 --> 01:28:46,569
Are you interested in politics?
- A little.

926
01:28:46,969 --> 01:28:50,669
I agree with you.
They're all crooks.

927
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:54,469
Yeah, but some crooks
take more than others.

928
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:59,069
If you don't follow politics,
it'll get you in the end.

929
01:28:59,169 --> 01:29:00,969
Especially the end of the month.

930
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,769
The end of the month,
the end of the road,

931
01:29:03,869 --> 01:29:06,769
the end of the movie.
I hate things that end.

932
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:09,369
- What's that?
- Nothing.

933
01:29:09,569 --> 01:29:13,269
I said you're really pretty, Marie.

934
01:29:30,969 --> 01:29:33,669
Hey, Antoine! Evening.

935
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:38,669
You look like you're sleep-walking.
I'm really glad to see you.

936
01:29:41,969 --> 01:29:46,469
Nothing like a good house
to complete a happy home!

937
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:09,969
Hi. Don't I owe you 100 francs?

938
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:12,169
No, not me!

939
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:45,969
<i>- It's me, Antoine.
- Where are you?</i>

940
01:30:46,069 --> 01:30:49,269
<i>- In a restaurant.
- And?</i>

941
01:30:49,369 --> 01:30:51,769
And nothing.

942
01:30:51,869 --> 01:30:55,469
Nothing special.
Just wanted to talk to you.

943
01:30:56,169 --> 01:30:58,369
Is something wrong?

944
01:30:58,569 --> 01:31:01,669
<i>No, it's just that...
I'm with someone.</i>

945
01:31:01,769 --> 01:31:04,069
<i>Mademoiselle Butterfly?</i>

946
01:31:04,269 --> 01:31:05,869
Right.

947
01:31:06,269 --> 01:31:09,469
I can't take it.
She never says a word.

948
01:31:10,269 --> 01:31:12,169
She just smiles and smiles.

949
01:31:12,269 --> 01:31:16,169
She expects me to be funny,
tell her stories.

950
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:20,069
<i>I'm fed up.
I'm not gonna try anymore.</i>

951
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:22,669
Antoine, you don't have to be mean.

952
01:31:22,869 --> 01:31:26,169
Oh, all right.
It's good to talk to you.

953
01:31:26,569 --> 01:31:27,669
Good-bye.

954
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:52,669
Did you make your call?

955
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:55,069
You should have started.

956
01:32:01,569 --> 01:32:04,469
- The next course, please.
- Would you like some cheese?

957
01:32:05,669 --> 01:32:07,569
Oh, I'm sorry. Kyoko?
- Yes.

958
01:32:07,604 --> 01:32:09,769
Cheese for the lady.

959
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:13,769
Excuse me.
I need to make another call.

960
01:32:34,169 --> 01:32:37,169
<i>- Christine, it's me again.
- Still at the restaurant?</i>

961
01:32:37,369 --> 01:32:40,669
It's dragging on terribly,
just as I expected.

962
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:43,469
<i>- I hope the food's good.
- Guess again! Rump steak!</i>

963
01:32:43,769 --> 01:32:48,069
We haven't spoken a word.
I feel like we've been here all day.

964
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:50,069
<i>Try to make an effort.</i>

965
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:53,469
I can't! I'm bored stiff.
I just want to get out of here!

966
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:56,969
Now she's ordered cheese!

967
01:32:57,569 --> 01:32:59,434
I've got to go.

968
01:32:59,469 --> 01:33:01,569
But if she orders dessert,
I'll kill myself!

969
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:21,469
Sure you wouldn't like some cheese?

970
01:33:21,769 --> 01:33:23,969
It's very good.

971
01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:41,969
Excuse me.
I have to make another call.

972
01:33:49,869 --> 01:33:52,669
- Is that our coffee?
- No, sir. I'll bring yours after dessert.

973
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:56,169
- Bring the check with the coffee.
- Very well, sir.

974
01:33:56,869 --> 01:33:58,969
With the coffee.

975
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:04,369
Christine, it's me again.

976
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:06,469
This is unbearable!

977
01:34:06,569 --> 01:34:09,769
She just ordered a souffle.
Another 20 minutes!

978
01:34:11,069 --> 01:34:13,569
<i>Are you there?
- Yes.</i>

979
01:34:14,769 --> 01:34:17,769
- Why don't you say anything?
- I'm listening to you.

980
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:21,769
<i>- You know, Christine...
- Yes?</i>

981
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:28,269
<i>I can't talk here anymore.</i>

982
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:32,769
<i>I'd like to kiss you.
- Me too.</i>

983
01:34:34,569 --> 01:34:37,369
<i>- Tenderly.
- Me too.</i>

984
01:34:38,069 --> 01:34:40,269
<i>- Really?
- Yes, really.</i>

985
01:34:41,569 --> 01:34:42,969
Good-bye.

986
01:35:10,869 --> 01:35:14,269
DROP DEAD

987
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:22,769
EPILOGUE: ONE YEAR LATER

988
01:35:27,569 --> 01:35:29,469
Let's go.

989
01:35:38,369 --> 01:35:40,769
Go back inside now.

990
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:44,469
I'm coming.

991
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:16,469
Thanks. I'm really late.

992
01:36:18,569 --> 01:36:20,269
Thank you very much.

993
01:36:27,969 --> 01:36:30,969
See, darling?
Now they're really in love.

994
01:36:37,769 --> 01:36:38,969
THE END
